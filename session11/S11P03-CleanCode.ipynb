    "## Some of Clean Code Rules\n",
    "- Naming Conventions\n",
    "    - Use meaningful names\n",
    "    - Use verbs for functions\n",
    "    - Use question format for functions or variables with boolean response type\n",
    "    - Use ```snake_case``` for _variables_ and _functions_\n",
    "    - User ```PascalCase``` for _classes_\n",
    "- Avoid Magic Numbers\n",
    "    - Use meaningful ```CONSTANT_VARIABLE``` for numbers\n",
    "- Avoid multiple nesting\n",
    "    - If you need more than 2 step of nested code, you should change your code\n",
    "- Comment Correctly\n",
    "    - Use comments to explain **why**, not **what**\n",
    "    - Code should answer **what** questions\n",
    "- Use Docstring\n",
    "    - Use docstring to explain function or class responsibility\n",
    "- Consider Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n",
    "    - Keep your functions small, with single responsibility\n",
    "    - It helps better maintenance and test\n",
    "    - If your function has more than 20 line, you should think about it\n",
    "- Consider Don't Repeat Yourself Principle (DRY)\n",
    "    - Try avoid duplication but don't overdo it\n",
    "- Keep your line length between 80 - 100 characters\n",
    "- If your function has more than 3 parameter, think about it\n",
    "    - Use a **dataclass** as parameter\n",
    "    - Chop-up your function\n",
    "\n",
