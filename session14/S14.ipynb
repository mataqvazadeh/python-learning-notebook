    "# Session 14: Introduction to Networking\n",
    "\n",
    "This session covers the basics of networking, including key networking commands and protocols. Practical exercises will help reinforce these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Networking Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Networking?\n",
    "- **Definition**: Connecting devices to share data and resources.\n",
    "- **Importance**: Everyday applications (e.g., web browsing, emails, file sharing).\n",
    "- **Components**: Servers, clients, routers, switches, and protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Network Terminology\n",
    "- **IP Address**: Unique identifier for devices on a network.\n",
    "- **MAC Address**: Hardware-based address of network interfaces.\n",
    "- **LAN/WAN**: Local Area Network vs. Wide Area Network.\n",
    "- **Packet**: Basic unit of data transmitted over a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Networking Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. ping\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Used to test network connectivity between your system and another host.\n",
    "- **How it works**: Sends ICMP Echo Request packets and waits for ICMP Echo Reply.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ping -c 4 google.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. traceroute / tracert\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Traces the route packets take from your system to a destination.\n",
    "- **How it works**: Uses ICMP (or UDP) packets with progressively increasing TTL values.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "traceroute google.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. ipconfig / ifconfig\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Displays your systemâ€™s network configuration, including IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.\n",
    "- **How it works**: Lists current configuration of network interfaces.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ifconfig    # Linux/macOS\n",
    "ipconfig    # Windows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. netstat\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Shows active network connections, open ports, and listening services on your machine.\n",
    "- **How it works**: Displays a list of open connections (TCP/UDP) and network statistics.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "netstat -tunapl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. nslookup\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Queries DNS servers to resolve a domain name to its IP address.\n",
    "- **How it works**: Sends DNS query requests to DNS servers.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nslookup google.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Protocols and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP/HTTPS\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Communication between web browsers and servers.\n",
    "- **Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\n",
    "- **Status Codes**: 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RESTful APIs\n",
    "- **Overview**: Using HTTP for CRUD operations.\n",
    "- **Real-life Example**: Fetching weather data from an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TCP/IP\n",
    "- **TCP**: Reliable data transmission with acknowledgment.\n",
    "- **IP**: Addressing and routing packets between devices.\n",
    "- **Subnetting and CIDR** (brief introduction).\n",
    "\n",
    "### DNS (Domain Name System)\n",
    "- **Function**: Resolving domain names to IP addresses.\n",
    "- **Example**: How 'google.com' translates to an IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load Balancing\n",
    "- **Definition**: Distributing traffic across multiple servers.\n",
    "- **Importance**: Scalability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Hands-On Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "### Networking Commands (Live Demo + Student Practice)\n",
    "- **ping**: Test connection to a public domain (e.g., ping google.com).\n",
    "- **tracert/traceroute**: Trace the route to a domain.\n",
    "- **ipconfig/ifconfig**: View local IP configuration.\n",
    "- **nslookup**: Resolve a domain name (e.g., nslookup yahoo.com).\n",
    "- **netstat**: Show open connections and listening ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Exploration Activity\n",
    "- **Identify the IP of a laptop or phone using ipconfig/ifconfig.**\n",
    "- **Use ping and traceroute to test connectivity and visualize paths.**\n",
    "- **Explore local network topology**: Map out devices connected to a home router.\n",
    "- **Identify shared/private IP ranges** (e.g., 192.168.x.x).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Router Configuration (Optional)\n",
    "- **Access router settings via a browser** (default gateway IP).\n",
    "- **Explain default credentials and basic settings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classroom Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple DHCP Practice\n",
    "- **Switch network adapter settings from DHCP (dynamic) to static IP.**\n",
    "- **Assign manual IP, gateway, and DNS, and test internet connectivity.**\n",
    "- **Revert to dynamic IP and verify connectivity.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Home Network Mapping\n",
    "- **Draw a diagram of devices connected to your home network.**\n",
    "- **Label each device with its local IP and MAC address.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Exercises\n",
    "- **Use ping and traceroute on different domains.** Note the hops and response times.\n",
    "- **Explore your router settings and find connected devices.**\n",
    "\n",
