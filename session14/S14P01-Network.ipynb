    "## Networking Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Networking?\n",
    "- **Definition**: Connecting devices to share data and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Idea of Networking\n",
    "- Initially, two computers could communicate using a **single cable** (point-to-point connection).\n",
    "- When a **third computer** is introduced, it becomes difficult to manage direct connections.\n",
    "- This led to various **network topologies**:\n",
    "  - **Point-to-Point**: Direct connection between two nodes.\n",
    "  - **Bus**: All devices share one backbone cable.\n",
    "  - **Ring**: Devices are connected in a circular fashion.\n",
    "  - **Mesh**: Every device connects to every other device.\n",
    "  - **Star**: Devices are connected to a **central device (router/switch)**.\n",
    "- Modern networks like the **internet** primarily use **star topology**, with **routers** at the center.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is an IP Address?\n",
    "- An **IP (Internet Protocol) address** is a **logical identifier** assigned to each device in a network.\n",
    "- Used to **identify where to send packets**.\n",
    "- Two versions:\n",
    "  - **IPv4**: e.g., 192.168.1.1 (most common today)\n",
    "    - 32-bit address, represented in **four decimal numbers** (0-255), separated by dots.\n",
    "    - Maximum of ~4.3 billion addresses.\n",
    "  - **IPv6**: e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334 (newer, more addresses)\n",
    "    - 128-bit address, represented in **eight groups of four hexadecimal digits**.\n",
    "    - Capable of providing **~340 undecillion addresses**.\n",
    "- A node can have many IP addresses:\n",
    "    - Loopback IP: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)\n",
    "    - LAN (Local Area Network): 192.168.0.1\n",
    "    - WAN (Wide Area Network): 144.126.82.21\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### MAC Address: The Device Fingerprint\n",
    "- A **MAC (Media Access Control) address** is a **unique identifier assigned to a network interface** (hardware).\n",
    "- Works at the **data link layer** (Layer 2 of OSI).\n",
    "- Used for **local network communication**.\n",
    "- A MAC address looks like: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Layers Overview:‌ OSI Model (Conceptual Overview)\n",
    "- The OSI model helps us understand how data moves through a network.\n",
    "- It has **7 layers**, from physical transmission to user-facing applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/osi.png\" alt=\"OSI Model\" style=\"width: 800px; margin: auto; display: block; background-color: white;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Focus for Programmers\n",
    "- As programmers, we mostly **interact with the Application layer** (Layer 7).\n",
    "- This includes:\n",
    "  - Web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS)\n",
    "  - Email (SMTP, IMAP)\n",
    "  - File transfers (FTP)\n",
    "  - DNS, REST APIs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "> While the other layers are important for network engineers, this course focuses mainly on the **Application layer** where developers operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Port?\n",
    "- A port is a logical endpoint for communication within a device, helping the device handle multiple services at once. It works like a door or window in a building that leads to different rooms, where each room is dedicated to a specific activity or service.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While the IP address identifies the device (the building), the port identifies a specific service or application on that device (the door or room where data needs to go). This allows multiple services to run on the same device using different ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Ports:\n",
    "- Well-Known Ports (0–1023): These are reserved for popular services, such as:\n",
    "    - HTTP (Port 80): Web browsing (unsecured).\n",
    "    - HTTPS (Port 443): Web browsing (secured).\n",
    "    - FTP (Port 21): File transfer.\n",
    "    - SMTP (Port 25): Sending emails.\n",
    "- Registered Ports (1024–49151): These ports are assigned to specific services but are not as widely known as the well-known ports. Example: Database or Redis.\n",
    "- Dynamic or Private Ports (49152–65535): These are used for temporary connections, typically assigned by the operating system for client-side applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Domain?\n",
    "- A domain is a human-readable address for a resource on the internet, such as a website. Instead of typing an IP address like 192.168.1.1, you use a domain name like example.com.\n",
    "- Domains are easier for people to remember and use than numeric IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is DNS (Domain Name System)?\n",
    "- The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the phone book of the internet. It translates domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 172.217.3.110) so that browsers can load resources.\n",
    "- DNS makes it easier for users to access websites without having to remember complex IP addresses. The process works like this:\n",
    "    1. You enter a domain name (e.g., www.google.com) into your browser.\n",
    "    2. Your computer sends a DNS query to a DNS server.\n",
    "    3. The DNS server returns the IP address corresponding to the domain name.\n",
    "    4. Your browser uses the IP address to establish a connection with the server and load the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Packet?\n",
    "- Data sent over a network is **broken into small chunks** called **packets**.\n",
    "- Each packet contains:\n",
    "  - Source IP\n",
    "  - Destination IP\n",
    "  - Payload (data)\n",
    "  - Other control information\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Networking Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. ping\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Used to test network connectivity between your system and another host.\n",
    "- **How it works**: Sends ICMP Echo Request packets and waits for ICMP Echo Reply.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ping -c 4 google.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. traceroute / tracert\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Traces the route packets take from your system to a destination.\n",
    "- **How it works**: Uses ICMP (or UDP) packets with progressively increasing TTL values.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "traceroute google.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. ipconfig / ifconfig / ip\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Displays your system’s network configuration, including IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.\n",
    "- **How it works**: Lists current configuration of network interfaces.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ip\n",
    "ifconfig    # Linux/macOS\n",
    "ipconfig    # Windows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. netstat\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Shows active network connections, open ports, and listening services on your machine.\n",
    "- **How it works**: Displays a list of open connections (TCP/UDP) and network statistics.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "netstat -tunapl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. nslookup\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Queries DNS servers to resolve a domain name to its IP address.\n",
    "- **How it works**: Sends DNS query requests to DNS servers.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nslookup google.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protocols and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP/HTTPS\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Communication between web browsers and servers.\n",
    "- **Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\n",
    "- **Status Codes**: 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RESTful APIs\n",
    "- **Overview**: Using HTTP for CRUD operations.\n",
    "- **Real-life Example**: Fetching weather data from an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load Balancing (Advance Topic)\n",
    "- **Definition**: Distributing traffic across multiple servers.\n",
    "- **Importance**: Scalability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time to Practice\n",
    "- **ping**: Test connection to a public domain (e.g., ping google.com).\n",
    "- **tracert/traceroute**: Trace the route to a domain.\n",
    "- **ipconfig/ifconfig**: Identify the IP of a laptop or phone using ipconfig/ifconfig.\n",
    "- **nslookup**: Resolve a domain name (e.g., nslookup yahoo.com).\n",
    "- **netstat**: Show open connections and listening ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SSH\n",
    "- With SSH (Secure Shell), you can connect to your linux server remotely\n",
    "- Connect to my server, check **uname** and other commands"
