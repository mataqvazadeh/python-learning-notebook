    "**What is SSH?**\n",
    "SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic protocol for secure communication over insecure networks. It uses **public-key cryptography**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Private Key:** Stored on your computer (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)—NEVER share this\n",
    "- **Public Key:** Stored on GitHub (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`)—safe to share\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. GitHub sends a challenge (random message)\n",
    "2. Your computer signs it with your Private Key\n",
    "3. GitHub verifies the signature with your Public Key\n",
    "4. If valid, you're authenticated—no password ever sent over the wire!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why safer than HTTPS?**\n",
    "- **No passwords:** Can't be keylogged or shoulder-surfed\n",
    "- **No tokens:** GitHub Personal Access Tokens expire and must be regenerated  \n",
    "- **Cryptographic proof:** Even if someone intercepts traffic, they can't reuse it (mathematically impossible to derive private key from public key)\n",
