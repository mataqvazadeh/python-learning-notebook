    "\n",
    "**Branches:**\n",
    "- `main`: Production only\n",
    "- `develop`: Integration branch\n",
    "- `feature/*`: New features (branch from develop)\n",
    "- `release/*`: Prepare release (branch from develop, merge to main + develop)\n",
    "- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes (branch from main, merge to main + develop)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "1. Create `feature/payment` from `develop`\n",
    "2. Work, commit, push\n",
    "3. Merge to `develop` via Pull Request\n",
    "4. When ready: branch `release/v1.0` from `develop`\n",
    "5. Bug fixes go to `release/v1.0`\n",
    "6. Merge `release/v1.0` to `main` (tag v1.0) and back to `develop`\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub Flow (The Simple)\n",
    "**Best for:** Web applications, continuous deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branches:**\n",
    "- `main`: Always deployable\n",
    "- `feature/*`: Short-lived branches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "1. Create `feature/add-auth` from `main`\n",
    "2. Work, commit, push\n",
    "3. Open Pull Request to `main`\n",
    "4. Review, merge, deploy immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:** Simple, fast. **Cons:** No staging environment for big releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trunk-Based Development (The Extreme)\n",
    "**Best for:** Large teams, CI/CD experts\n",
    "\n",

    "**Technique:**\n",
    "- **Branch by Abstraction:** Keep unfinished features behind feature flags\n",
    "- **Short-lived branches:** Max 1-day lifetime\n",
