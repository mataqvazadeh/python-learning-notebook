    "## Rebase: Rewriting History for Cleanliness\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Rebase?\n",
    "Rebase moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It literally \"re-bases\" your branch onto another point in history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before rebase:\n",
    "```\n",
    "main:       A --- B --- C\n",
    "                      \\\n",
    "feature:                D --- E --- F\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After `git rebase main`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "main:       A --- B --- C\n",
    "                         \\\n",
    "feature:                   D' --- E' --- F'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice: `D`, `E`, `F` become `D'`, `E'`, `F'`—they have new hashes because their parent changed from `C` to `C` (technically same parent, but if main moved forward, they get replayed on top).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Rebase?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem with Merge:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "main:    A --- B --- C --- G (merge commit)\n",
    "                \\         /\n",
    "feature:          D --- E\n",
    "```\n",
    "The merge commit `G` clutters history. It looks like parallel universes collided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Rebase Solution:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "main:    A --- B --- C --- D' --- E'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Linear history! It looks like you wrote `D` and `E` after `C` was done, even though you started when `B` was latest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Rebase vs Merge\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Use | Result |\n",
    "|----------|-----|--------|\n",
    "| Local feature branch, not yet pushed | `rebase main` | Clean linear history |\n",
    "| Shared branch (origin/main) | `merge` | Preserve true history |\n",
    "| Integrating finished feature | `merge --no-ff` | Preserve feature existence |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Rebase: The History Editor\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean up messy commits before sharing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Last 3 commits\n",
    "git rebase -i HEAD~3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Editor opens with:\n",
    "pick a1b2c3d Add power function\n",
    "pick b2c3d4e WIP: fix bug  \n",
    "pick c3d4e5f Fix typo in comment\n",
    "\n",
    "# Change to:\n",
    "pick a1b2c3d Add power function\n",
    "squash b2c3d4e WIP: fix bug\n",
    "fixup c3d4e5f Fix typo in comment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactive Commands:**\n",
    "- `pick` (p): Use commit as-is\n",
    "- `reword` (r): Change commit message\n",
    "- `edit` (e): Stop to amend the commit (add files, split commit)\n",
    "- `squash` (s): Combine with previous commit (keeps both messages, you edit combined message)\n",
    "- `fixup` (f): Combine with previous commit (discards this message)\n",
    "- `drop` (d): Delete commit entirely\n",
    "- `exec` (x): Run a shell command after this commit\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Golden Rule of Rebasing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Never rebase commits that exist outside your repository!**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you rebase commits already pushed to `origin/feature`, and someone else pulled that branch, you create alternate reality. When you force-push, their next pull will create a merge nightmare.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safe Rebase Workflow:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# 1. Update main\n",
    "git switch main\n",
    "git pull origin main\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Rebase your local feature onto latest main\n",
    "git switch feature\n",
    "git rebase main\n",
    "# (fix any conflicts during rebase)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. If you already pushed feature (and you're alone on it)\n",
    "git push --force-with-lease origin feature\n",
    "# --force-with-lease checks nobody else pushed before overwriting\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rebase vs Merge: Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** You worked on `feature` for 3 days. Main moved forward with 10 new commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Merge approach:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git switch feature\n",
    "git merge main\n",
    "# Creates merge commit, keeps exact history of when you branched\n",
    "# History shows parallel development (truthful but messy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rebase approach:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git switch feature  \n",
    "git rebase main\n",
    "# Replays your commits on top of latest main\n",
    "# History looks like you started today (clean but rewritten)\n",
    "# May need to resolve conflicts multiple times (once per commit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Professional Tip:** Rebase local branches for clean history. Merge shared branches to preserve truth."
